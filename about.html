      <p>Kai was born from a simple question: why should travel planning feel like a chore? We believe that every journey should reflect the traveller behind it – their tastes, moods and spontaneous whims.</p>
      <p>Our team of designers, engineers and storytellers came together to build a travel companion that feels like a trusted friend. Powered by machine learning and informed by real human experiences, Kai crafts itineraries that adapt to you, not the other way around.</p>
      <p>We’re passionate about uncovering hidden corners of the world and connecting people to them in meaningful ways. Whether you’re wandering solo, adventuring with family or living the digital nomad life, Kai is here to help you tell your story.</p>
